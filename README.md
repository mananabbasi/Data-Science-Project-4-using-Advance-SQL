# Data-Science-Project-4-using-Advance-SQL
For the second task, you should use the three csv files provided for you on Blackboard. These  files are an excerpt from a larger file which is a real-world dataset. The file provides the  information on restaurants, consumers and the review. The data includes four related tables, which are provided in four csv files:
1. Write a query that lists all restaurants with a Medium range price with open area, 
serving Mexican food.
2. Write a query that returns the total number of restaurants who have the overall rating 
as 1 and are serving Mexican food. Compare the results with the total number of 
restaurants who have the overall rating as 1 serving Italian food (please give 
explanations on their comparison)
Assessment Information/Brief
6
3. Calculate the average age of consumers who have given a 0 rating to the 'Service_rating' 
column. (NB: round off the value if it is a decimal)
4. Write a query that returns the restaurants ranked by the youngest consumer. You 
should include the restaurant name and food rating that is given by that customer to 
the restaurant in your result. Sort the results based on food rating from high to low.
5. Write a stored procedure for the query given as:
Update the Service_rating of all restaurants to '2' if they have parking available, either 
as 'yes' or 'public'
6. You should also write four queries of your own and provide a brief explanation of the 
results which each query returns. You should make use of all of the following at least 
once:
Nested queries-EXISTS
Nested queries-IN
System functions
